                            According to The Governorâ€™s Office of Student
                            Achievement, in August 2013 and January 2014,
                            education stakeholders from the public and private
                            sectors met to develop a strategic plan that charts
                            the expansion of PBIS in Georgia. Of the five
                            strategic goals, administrators, coaches, and
                            teachers are required to increase awareness and
                            visibility of PBIS while expanding data
                            infrastructure to lead and support PBIS
                            implementation. The data should be used to support
                            evidence-based behavioral practices for improving
                            school climate. Each school must find their own way
                            to adhere to state-wide PBIS expectations, and unify
                            the mission and vision of the district with their
                            individual school matrix and discipline flow charts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Schools are also tasked with creating their own
                            incentive programs to reward students for desired
                            behaviors. Information obtained from numerical
                            (points) and anecdotal submissions can be used to
                            identify areas of concern, as well as to increase
                            focus on students that are meeting and exceeding
                            expectations. Validity of the data is dependent upon
                            staff participation, and it is important for schools
                            to develop a universal system that is centralized
                            and easy for staff to use.

                            Educator-driven data collection also supports PBIS
                            Tier I, Tier II, and Tier III processes when
                            implemented with consistency. In our presentation,
                            we will discuss how administrators and teachers can
                            utilize the district level G-Suite Applications, via
                            Google Slides, Sites, Forms, and Sheets, to create a
                            universal data system which will evaluate the
                            implementation of PBIS practices and improve the
                            climate and culture of the school.
